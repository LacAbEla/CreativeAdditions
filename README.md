# LacAbEla's Creative Additions
LacAbEla's useful and weird additions to spice up your (my) creative worlds/server.

## Changes:
* ### Endermen won't mess up your landscapes
  When endermen try to remove a block they will pick up air instead.<br>
  They will also briefly catch fire as a punishment for their actions.

## TODO:
* ### Cuffs for villagers
  Prevent those pesky villagers from getting away when they do something bad!<br>
  These will prevent the villager from moving.

* ### Leashable villagers
  You will now be able to attach a lead to villagers.<br>
  This will allow you to relocate them to a better place, like jail.

* ### Fireball launcher
  Fire! Explosions! What else do you want from me?
